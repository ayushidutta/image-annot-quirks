##### [Sec 4.1 in paper, Tables 5-6 ] Performance by replacing incorrect predictions with rare/frequent/random incorrect labels.

##### [Sec 4.1 in paper, Table 7] Performance by assigning the three most rare, the three most frequent, and three randomly chosen labels to each test image. 

## Label Diversity

##### [Sec 4.2.1 in paper, Table 8] Percentage “unique” and “novel” label-sets.

## Image Diversity

##### [Sec 4.2.2 in paper, Tables 9-12] Performance over the 20% most and least overlapping test subsets of various datasets.
